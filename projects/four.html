                        Virtualized work environments facilitate testing and simulating actual and hypothetical scenarios, feeding relevant information back into the actual environment. This is valuable in the context of data-driven Industry 4.0, where generalized requirements concerning a more thorough analysis of workers’ activities in several settings are required. This project aims to extract video-based information about personnel activities in their workplaces, aiming at ergonomic risk assessment and prevention, safety conditions, and overall monitoring. The extracted parameters inform ergonomists or managers regarding situations or contexts that require intervention. (DOI: 10.1109/ICECET55527.2022.9872882).</p>
                        <p>Digital twin technology is designed to use real world data together with simulation programs to understand or predict how a process or activity is being performed.
                        This technology arose in the last decade in several industrial contexts, mostly focused on devices, facilities and manufacturing, and only very recently to twinning human behavior.
                        This paper describes an applied study on digital twinning of workers within complex and varying industrial settings, using the recently introduced VIBE neural network.
                        VIBE comprises a two-stage pipeline of neural network blocks (NNB), where the first stage determines detection and tracking, while the second stage performs 2D-to-3D human model mapping.
                        The first stage allows using three different NNB combinations, namely Mask R-CNN \& SORT, YOLO \& {SORT}, and STAF.
                        In this work, we focus on the influence of each NNB on the second stage and the final output using state-of-the-art performance metrics.
                        Mask R-CNN \& SORT provided a multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 87,2\%, while STAF obtained a MOTA of 88,5\% and the best performance with occlusions in the final 2D-to-3D human rendering.
                        These results pave the road for new developments in real-time complex digital twinning and workplace virtualization, in which human activities are an essential part.</p>

                    <p>Cloud-based platform for crop produce management. As a third sector organization, the Chamber of Crop Producers of Bahía Blanca assists their affiliates in the provision of the most complete and comprehensive information service for the entire agricultural production chain in the five more economically significant types of crops in the region (wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflower, and corn). For this, the Agroinfinity platform (<a href="http://agroinfinito.com.ar/"> http://agroinfinito.com.ar/</a>) automates the most relevant processes (loading satellite images, meteorology, information processing, analysis of series of time, etc.) together with outstanding information collected right by the producers, users and other actors. The fusion of the different sources of information together with its interpretation by expert agronomists and producers makes it possible to design an integrated information management and analysis system in extensive areas. AgroInfinito represents a strategic development that goes beyond the purely technological aspects. It is an open innovation tool, promoting the creation of value aiming at the digital transformation of the agricultural production system (<a href="https://agroinfinito.com.ar/">https://agroinfinito.com.ar/</a>).</p>

<p>Argentina has had a worldwide privileged position as one of the biggest grain and oil seed producers. The agricultural sector plays a key role in the country's economy and requires the generation of more strategic agro-productive information. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries is the main entity collecting and reporting productive data in Argentina. However, these reports are not equally carried out in peripheral areas. Our country has the potential to have large-scale agricultural production and develop a powerful agro-business in order to create a new economic growth engine. The constant sector growth thanks to agrotechnology (Agtech) is changing the traditional methodology of generating agricultural information. For this reason, in the southwest of Buenos Aires (SOB) and the Port of Bahia Blanca's area, the development of a computerized geotechnological platform is introduced. AgroInfinito integrates and analyzes data from different sources, and provides a comprehensive information service for the entire agricultural production chain in the five more economically significant types of crops in the region (wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflower, and corn). The platform automates the most relevant processes (loading satellite images of the constellations involved, meteorology, information processing, analysis of series of time, etc.) together with outstanding information collected right by the producers, users and other actors through a specifically developed app. It also incorporates field information periodically obtained by expert agronomists who are part of the work team. The fusion of the different sources of information together with its interpretation by expert agronomists and producers makes it possible to design an integrated information management and analysis system in extensive areas. AgroInfinito represents a strategic development that goes beyond the purely technological aspects. It is an open innovation tool, promoting the creation of value aiming at the digital transformation of the agricultural production system.</p>
